<h1>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
    <p>I consider myself as a coder. The coder mainly focused on rendering map using innovative and advanced technology. Different from the cartographers who devote to explore the implication behind the data ad maps, the coders are more like executors.  I am a student in another field. The reason I learn the online mapping is to be proficient in an advanced technology, a specific tool. I feel excited to see how an interactive maps works. A map for me is a media to present the data, so I will do my best to make this media as extraordinary as possible. Therefore, I position myself as a coder among the three roles in mapping. As an unprofessional coder, not only work with mapping technology to present the data in the objective environment, also creating an interactive map of my own career life all the time. The reason why I call it an interactive map is I change the priorities based on different stages during “mapping”. Currently, creativeness is my priority because I feel motivated. My way of thinking is around ‘how to be different’ all the time, and it reflect on everything happened in my life, not just career life.</p>
    
    <p>In my opinion, the forth manifesto, pretty maps are better than ugly maps although ugly maps will do in a pinch, is the most problematic statement compared the other five. How to define the beauty or ugliness of maps? What is a pretty map or a ugly map? The definition varies from different situations. Whether a map is able to deliver the information accurately and efficiently is the most important standard. The effect of visualization can be considered as the second priority. Also, people always see want to see. This thinking pattern means there is no uniform criteria to define a map. A so-called perfect map may be a mess in an eye of a child.</p>
